If you cleaned your reads using `Captus` then the data is ready for analysis inside the directory you chose for the cleaned reads (`./01_cleaned_reads/` by default). Then you can proceed to check the [Options]({{< ref "/assembly/assemble/options">}}) of the `assemble` command.

If you want to provide reads cleaned elsewhere, please follow the same <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> [**naming convention**]({{< ref "/assembly/clean/preparation">}}) required for raw reads and place your FASTQ files preferably in a single directory.
