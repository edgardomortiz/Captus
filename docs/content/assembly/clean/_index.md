Unless you are starting with your own assemblies, cleaning will be the first step in the analysis. `Captus` makes it easy to process many samples in a consistent manner, automatically, and providing a comprehensive Quality Control HTML report.

`Captus` allows you the flexibility to provide reads cleaned elsewhere. however, we recommend our cleaning method for its accuracy in removing adaptors, which in turn improves the chances of getting a higher quality assembly. If you are interested in why we chose `BBTools` for cleaning, please read: [<i class="fab fa-readme"></i> Why BBTools?]({{< ref "bbduk">}})

In case you still want to start with previously cleaned reads, you can jump ahead to the [`assemble` command]({{< ref "assemble">}}) page.
