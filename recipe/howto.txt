# How to modify recipe in bioconda

1. Fork bioconda-recipes in your GitHub account, if you did this in the past sync it and pull changes locally

2. Create a branch, the name of the branch should indicate what we are doing: e.g. fix_captus_recipe
cd path_to_bioconda-recipes
git checkout -b fix_captus_recipe

3. Open VSCode to make edits, verify in the bottom that you are working on the new branch

4. Save changes, commit with GitHub desktop, also creates pull request
If it is only a change in recipe, not new captus version, increse build number +1

5. BiocondaBot will start testing the new recipe, when tests are passed write in the pull request
@BiocondaBot please add label

6. Wait until BiocondaBot updates everything

7. Important: Delete branch!! otherwise future changes in this branch will create merge conflicts.
